            <p>A printed circuit board electronics assembly / production or manufacturing process there are a number of individual stages. However it is necessary for them all to work together to form an integrated overall process. Each stage of assembly and production must be compatible with the next, and there must be feedback from the output to the input to ensure that 
                the highest quality is maintained. In this way any problems are detected quickly and the process can be adjusted accordingly</p>

            <p>A Wire Harness, also known as a cable harness or wiring assembly, is a grouping of wires, cables, or subassemblies designed to transmit signals or electrical power. A basic Wire Harness may include as few as three discreet components,
                 while the more classic harnesses include many more wires and other passive, and potentially active, components.</p>
